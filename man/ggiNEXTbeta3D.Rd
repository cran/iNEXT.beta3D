\title{ggplot2 extension for the iNEXTbeta3D object}
\usage{
ggiNEXTbeta3D(output, type = "B")
}
\arguments{
\item{output}{output from the function \code{iNEXTbeta3D}.}

\item{type}{(argument only for \code{base = "coverage"}),\cr
\code{type = 'B'} for plotting the rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves for gamma, alpha, and beta diversity;  \cr
\code{type = 'D'} for plotting the rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves for four dissimilarity indices.\cr
Skip the argument for plotting size-based rarefaction and extrapolation sampling curves for gamma and alpha diversity.}
}
\value{
a figure for gamma, alpha, and beta diversity, or a figure for four dissimilarity indices for \code{base = "coverage"}; 
or a figure for gamma and alpha diversity when \code{base = "size"}.\cr
}
\description{
\code{ggiNEXTbeta3D} is an \code{ggplot2} extension for the \code{iNEXTbeta3D} 
object to plot sample-size- and coverage-based rarefaction/extrapolation curves.
